2D Platformer turned rage game, 10/24/2020

2D Platformer with rage game elements

## Implementation
I included an animated player, platforms, background and foreground elements, different levels and an end screen. I put enemies in the game but they don't work how they're supposed to, one you can see when you make it to the second level flys backwards and down and the 2nd one you can't even see because it flew backwards too far.

## Future Development
Put in a save and load system, I tried implementing one but I couldn't convert it from numbers to saving the player's state but I think I handled it well by making it a rage game instead where when you die you have to restart and there are many fake platforms.

## Please Read
IMPORTANT: This game was made intentionally difficult with cheap tricks like fake platforms and difficult jumps. I have beaten it so it is proven to be winnable.
